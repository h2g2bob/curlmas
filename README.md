Some people use legacy paper-based advent calendar technology, but I use
cloud-based time tracking technology.

Downloading the web page will finish on Christmas morning, and the progress
bar of `curl` gives the percentage of advent which has happened.


Usage
=====

Run with
`python3 curlmas.py`


Test with a webbrowser or with `nc`.
